            <p>I developed this game for my high school capstone project in the fall of 2023. To make the game I used the <em>GameMaker</em> game engine which uses the <em>GameMaker Language (GML)</em>. 
                I also used a website called <em>Itch.io</em> to be able to publish the game online for anyone to play for free. <br></p>
            <p>Fall Jump is a platformer game where you try to climb to the top as fast as you can. But this isn't as easy as it seems, you need to utilize strategic movements,
                teleportation and climbing through blocks all while avoiding falling back down and having to restart. At the end there is a local leaderboard to keep track of the fastest times on your machine.</p>
